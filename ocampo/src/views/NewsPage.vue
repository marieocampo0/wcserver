            <h2>First look at Jang Ki-yong, Jin Se-yeon, Lee Soo-hyuk in new drama ‘Born Again’</h2>
            <h3>KBS2 has released the first character stills for its upcoming drama Born Again starring Jang Ki-yong, Jin Se-yeon, and Lee Soo-hyuk.</h3>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fHgTm5Cp9A"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3fHgTm5Cp9A/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="bornagain"> </a>
        <p> Born Again is a mystery melodrama about three people with tragically interconnected fates 
            who have first met in the 1980s. The three have reincarnated at present as totally different people, 
            but their lives remain connected in the same way. </p>
            
            
            <p>Jang Ki-yong plays a loner with a terrible secret in his past life 
            and a medical student in the present. Jang seems to have undergone a massive transformation in his stills. He is seen 
            sporting wildly overgrown hair and a black jacket, looking like a lone wolf.</p>
